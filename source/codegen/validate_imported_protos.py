"""Script validating that any imported proto file matches its corresponding generated one.

Expects import path as source/codegen/metadata and generated folder path.

Background: 
All MI driver metadata is being imported from hapigen. We're also creating .proto files
based on the metadata in that component. So when an MI driver is updated, the export will have
a metadata folder with [attributes.py, config.py, enums.py, functions.py, <driver-name>.proto].
Someone will import those five files to grpc-device's source/codegen/metadata folder.

Purpose: 
Since, at the moment, we have both grpc-device and hapigen generating the driver .proto files 
we want a way to validate that they're creating equivalent ones. This script will check imported
.proto files (copied out of hapigen-based driver exports) against their corresponding .proto file
that gets generated in grpc-device to make sure they match.

On Mismatch:
1. Make sure .proto from driver export is copied over to grpc-device
2. Make sure you built grpc-device locally to get any generated folder changes
   (specifically .proto files there)
3. The proto generators (mako and helper python files) likely changed between grpc-device and
   hapigen and need to be synced up.
